# Creating my own Rails Web App

This is my attempt at creating my first own web application utilizing the Rails framework. Much of the methods I've used in development were derived from these four main resources:

1. Ruby on Rails Tutorial: by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/)
2. RailsGuide: by [rubyonrails.org](http://rubyonrails.org)
3. The Rails Way: by [Obie Fernandez](https://leanpub.com/tr4w)
4. Ruby on Rails Essential Training: by [lynda.org]
